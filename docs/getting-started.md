# Getting Started Guide

The first task is to create a fork of the repository in your own Github account. Please see (https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)[https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/]

Once the repository is cloned, open the project in Visual Studio - it's configured to use IIS express so will not need any setup, you can start by opening the SLN file in \source\Our.Umbraco.NonProfitFramework.sln
