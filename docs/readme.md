# Getting Started Guide

The first task is to create a fork of the repository in your own Github account. Please see [https://guides.github.com/activities/forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

Once the repository is cloned, open the project in Visual Studio - it's configured to use IIS express so will not need any setup, you can start by opening the SLN file in \source\Our.Umbraco.NonProfitFramework.sln

Once built, log in to the back end with the following credentials

 - Back End url : /Umbraco#/content
 - Backend user: people@umbracocommunity.com
 - Backend pw: g5##fsS?TK4xfN*J

Once logged in, you will need to restore the site from within uSync in the Settings section, import everything by clicking the import dropdown and choosing import everything. Let this run and it will create the document types and content for the site needed.

Once that's done you have your bare-bones site.
